	<h1><a href="">iex Annotations</a></h1>
	<p>
		iex annotations allow you to place notes on an image without actually editing the image.
		This can be useful for quickly translating image elements without having to edit or upload a new image.
	</p>


	<h2 id="viewing"><a href="#viewing">Viewing annotations</a></h2>
	<p>
		Annotations are loaded from posts containing an <a>[iex:a/ANNOTATIONDATA]</a> tag.
		This tag contains positioning and formatting information for the annotations.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the script has detected the tag, the annotations will be applied to the image when it is hovered.
		Additionally, links to the image (including the tag itself) can be clicked to open the image in a new
			tab <em>and</em> show the annotations in that tab.
	</p>
	<p>
		If multiple annotation tags are detected for the same image, the annotations can be toggled through
			by using the hotkey, which is by default the "<code>A</code>" key.
	</p>


	<h2 id="opening"><a href="#opening">Opening the editor</a></h2>
	<p>
		The annotation editor can be opened by opening a quick reply form and then doing one of the following:
	</p>
	<p><ul>
		<li>
			Select a file by using either of the available file selection buttons.<br />
			<span class="small small_block">note that with appchan-x, you may have to select the file twice due to some script incompatabilities</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			Select a file by clicking the <strong>URL</strong> button and then inputting a URL to an image.<br />
			<span class="small small_block">this is for uploading by URL on 4chan-x and similar extensions</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			Quote a post with an image and the post reference drop-down should auto-select.<br />
			<span class="small small_block">with this method, uploading an image is not necessary</span>
		</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p>
		The first two methods apply the annotations to an image uploaded with the post.
		The second method will apply the annotations to an image that is referenced in the post.
		This allows raw images to be uploaded and annotations to be added later.
	</p>


	<h2 id="editor_image"><a href="#editor_image">Editor image window</a></h2>
	<p>
		In the annotation editor, there will be an image window and several options for annotation styling.
	</p>
	<p>
		The image can be scrolled by clicking and dragging with the left/middle mouse buttons, and
			scaled using the mouse wheel.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once annotations are added, they can be moved by clicking and dragging;
			resized by clicking and dragging around the border;
			and sized-to-fit by double clicking.
	</p>


	<h2 id="styling"><a href="#styling">Editor styling</a></h2>
	<p>
		The rest of the editor contains styling features, most of which are probably not useful.
		Includes:
	</p>
	<p><ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Colors</strong> - for text, decoration, and background
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Alignment</strong> - vertical and horizontal alignment of the text
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Font</strong> - font family, size, bold, and italic settings for the font
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Decoration</strong> - text decorations in the form of varying shadows
		</li>
	</ul></p>


	<h2 id="text_formatting"><a href="#text_formatting">Text formatting</a></h2>
	<p>
		In addition to the styles above, single lines of text can have formatters in them to change how they're displayed.
		These can be added into the text editors in the editor window to achieve the following effects:
	</p>
	<p><ul>
		<li>
			<strong>\\</strong> - outputs a single backslash character<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>\b</strong> - inverts the current font bold setting
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>\i</strong> - inverts the current font italic setting
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>\n</strong> - outputs a single newline
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>\h</strong> - hyphenates a word and inserts a newline
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>\c<span class="formatter_value">X.</span><span class="formatter_value">YY</span><span class="formatter_value">:</span></strong> - changes a color<br />
			<span class="small small_block"><strong><span class="formatter_value">X.</span></strong> - optional; indicates the color to change (0=text; 1=decoration; 2=background)</span>
			<span class="small small_block"><strong><span class="formatter_value">YY</span></strong> - the index of the color to use; hover over a color in the editor for its color index</span>
			<span class="small small_block"><strong><span class="formatter_value">:</span></strong> - optional; only required to delimit in case the next character is a digit</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>\d<span class="formatter_value">X</span></strong> - changes the text decoration<br />
			<span class="small small_block"><strong><span class="formatter_value">X</span></strong> - the decoration to change to; hover over the decoration selector to find a decoration index</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>\C</strong> - resets all colors to their defaults
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>\D</strong> - resets the text decoration to its default
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>\R</strong> - resets all text formattings to their defaults
		</li>
	</ul></p>


	<h2 id="quick_reply_editing"><a href="#quick_reply_editing">Quick reply editing</a></h2>
	<p>
		Annotations can also be edited directly from the quick reply textarea, though it's not as flexible.
		This allows for copy-pasting annotations from other sources to quickly continue editing.
	</p>
	</p>
		The <a>[iex]</a> tag should automatically update once the textarea changes focus.
	</p>


	<h2 id="settings"><a href="#settings">Settings</a></h2>
	<p>
		The settings includes many options for annotations,
			including options to disable,
			modify image URLs or not,
			transparency of annotations,
			the hoykey for toggling,
			and some defaults for the editor.
	</p>
